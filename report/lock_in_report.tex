\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Lock In detection}
\label{intro: lock_in_detection}
\subsection{Data Analysis Module}
 While performing a Lock-In experiment, detected oscilloscope results can be returned in the form of \textbf{.csv} or \textbf{.png} files.
 However, there are too many time points in each \textbf{.csv} file, it is recommended to read the oscilloscope screen for each detection.
 Also, each experiment has various parameters controlled by each panel so the modification of each data takes complicated forms.
 Therefore, I build a clean module for a Lock-In experiment result analysis that can help the successor in two big ways.

 First, it supports \verb|lock_in_data| type and \verb|read_png()| method so that helps to read \textbf{.png} file fast.
 To run this module, we need a labeled Excel file that informs the parameters and the picture name.
 For example, let the preamplifier experiment of gain 2, input signal frequency of $50  [kHz]$ be saved by the file name "TEK000056.png".
 Then the labeled Excel file should contain a row 2, 50, and 56.
 And also the column of the picture name should be "name".
 We must modify the \verb|get_data_labels()|, which is the detected value of the oscilloscope \textbf{.png} for each experiment.
 I assumed that each experiment is placed in a different sheet of Excel file.
 
 \begin{verbatim}
reading 183 out of 701
Commit data: 1960
Commit data: 208
Commit data: 45.72
Commit data: -45.58
1_amplitude : 1960
2_amplitude : 208
12_phase : 45.72
21_phase : -45.58
{'gain': 10.0, 'frequency(kHz)': 200}
 \end{verbatim}
 

 By running \verb|main.py|, the example output above prints out.
 The module crops the exact position of the oscilloscope screenshots in \verb|./ERROR.PNG|, the only work to do is to read the number in the image.
 The commission of data is grouped simultaneously in \verb|lock_in_data| type and saved by \verb|datum. pkl|.
 The \verb|datum| is a dictionary that contains each experiment and data conveniently.
 For example, \verb|datum['preamplifier'][0]| is data collected in the preamplifier circuit the first time.

 Second, this module makes the plotting even more convenient.
 The Lock-In experiment needs to control some parameters and only plots a graph with selected parameters and results.
 Therefore, there must be a repeated structure of a plotting code scheme, which is very uncomfortable and crummy.
 In \verb|lock_in_data.py| header have the method of \verb|phys_plot()| which supports the faster way to plot a list of \verb|lock_in_data| type.
 For example, the code following plots the ratio of \verb|data. results[0]| and \verb|data. results[1]| in the function of signal frequency, only for the gain parameter set by 1.

 \begin{verbatim}
    fig = lock_in_data.phys_plot(
        datum[experiment],
        'frequency(kHz)',
        lambda x : x.results[0]/x.results[1], 
        {'gain': 1},
        x_label="frequency [kHz]",
        y_label= "Amplitude_ratio",
        fmt = 'ko'
        )    
 \end{verbatim}

 Every code and raw data is uploaded in \cite{github}, it is complete by itself so that only running \verb|main.py| will help the successor to use this module.
 For window system users must change the \verb|./| to \verb|.\\| to detour compatibility.

\section{Methods}
\label{methods: start}
Apparatus: Signal Processor (\cite{signal_processor}), oscilloscope, function generator, MG910 Hall ellement(\cite{hall_sensor})
The Lock-In module has been set up in the intermediate physics experiment laboratory, at Seoul National University.
The signal processor from Teach Spin is modular architecture with multiple circuits such as a preamplifier, and low pass amplifier.
I subtly improve the experimental method, especially the circuit modification, to specify the phase difference between the signal and reference input.
Every result of each experiment is in \ref{results: start} with the same subsection name.

\subsection{Preamplifier}
 The preamplifier circuit is not modified.
 Fig. \ref{fig: preamplifier_circuit}(a) shows the preamplifier circuit I used.
 Fig. \ref{fig: preamplifier_circuit}(b) is one of the raw data results while performing the circuit.

 \begin{figure}[ht]

  (b)The oscilloscope screen capture of frequency 200 $kHz$ and gain$=2$.
  The blue line is the reference input and the yellow line is the signal output.}
  \label{fig: preamplifier_circuit}
\end{figure}
 I measured 57 different frequencies in each gain 1, 2, 5, 10, 20.
\subsection{Phase Shifter: Lagging phase detection}
The phase shifter provided in the signal processor is not uniformly performing, so the shifted phase is dependent on input signal frequency.
I define the word lagged phase as the difference between the real shifted phase and the displayed phase shift.
The manual suggests using the linear regression results of this measurement to complement the lagged phase, but as \ref{results: phase shifter} shows that the shifted phase amount is too big to cause errors.
Therefore I use three channels in the oscilloscope at the base of this circuit.
The first two of them are a reference and the phase-shifted signal just like this experiment circuit.
And the last one is set to the final signal of each experiment.
I have emphasized the modified circuit in each subsection.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/phase_shifter_circuit.png}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../raw_data/TEK00306.PNG}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \caption{Schematic diagram of (a) phase shifter circuit, adapted form  \cite{signal_processor}.
    (b)The oscilloscope screen capture of frequency 150 $Hz$ and $\pi/2$ phase shifted.
    The blue line is the reference input and the yellow line is the signal output.}
    \label{fig: phase_shifter_circuit}
  \end{figure}

 Fig. \ref{fig: phase_shifter_circuit}(b) shows the exact lagged phase in the module.
 The phase shifted amount displayed on the signal processor is $\pi/2$ but its real shifted phase is about $\pi$.
 I measured 17 different frequencies in each displayed phase shift value.

 \subsection{Lock In detection: DBM}
 The Lock-In detection is implemented by Double Balanced Mixer(DBM) explained at \ref{intro: lock_in_detection}.
 In this experiment, the DBM performance is checked.
 However, the lagged phase induced by the phase shifter and preamplifier huts the accurate measurement of the following experiments,
 I also display the phase-shifted input signal of the DBM module in the third channel of the oscilloscope.
 \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/DBM_circuit.png}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../raw_data/TEK00396.PNG}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \caption{Schematic diagram of (a) DBM circuit, adapted form  \cite{signal_processor}.
    (b)The oscilloscope screen capture of frequency 200 $Hz$ and $\pi/2$ phase shifted.
    The yellow line is the reference input and the purple line is the phase-shifted input.
    The blue line is the DBM output which performs well.
    }
    \label{fig: DBM_circuit}
  \end{figure}
 Fig. \ref{fig: DBM_circuit}(a) is the manual circuit arrangement, which has an inevitable error by the lagged phase.
 But by the subtle line connection, we can display the exact phase shit in the oscilloscope and can measure the real shift phase.
 So in the rest of the experiments, I modulate the phase difference by the measured value displayed in the oscilloscope.
 Fig. \ref{fig: DBM_circuit}(b) is the example results of the DBM experiment.
 It is definite to claim the phase difference between two input waves is $\pi/2$.
 But by the unavoidable error, the phase difference value fluctuates about $5\degree$, I read the median value while experimenting.
 I measured 21 different frequencies in each phase shift value of 0, $\pi/2$, $\pi$, and $3\pi/2$.

\subsection{Low-Pass Amplifier}
 The direct current offset is filtered by the low-pass amplifier.
 The amplifier has three parameters of $dB/oct$ and the time constant of the LC circuit.

 \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/low_pass_amplifier_circuit.png}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../raw_data/TEK00453.PNG}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \caption{Schematic diagram of (a) low pass amplifier circuit, adapted form  \cite{signal_processor}.
    (b)The oscilloscope screen capture of frequency 10 $Hz$ and $6 dB/oct$, the time constant of 0.1 s.
    The yellow line is the reference input and the blue line is the low-pass amplifier output which performs well.
    }
    \label{fig: low_pass_amplifier_circuit}
  \end{figure}

 Since it is applied to filter the high-frequency signals, in order of time constants, I have measured the signal for $0.1Hz$ to $50Hz$.
 The 10Hz result is even undetectable, as Fig. \ref{fig: low_pass_amplifier_circuit}(b) shows.
 Also widely broaden bandlike signal is observed, which is detailed in \ref{results: low pass filter}

 \subsection{Lock-In Amplifier: Noise detection}
 There are two steps in the noise detection experiment.
 The first is to check whether the noise provided by the signal processor is qualified by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) included in the oscilloscope.
 The second is to form a Lock-In detection experiment to figure out a signal from the noise.
 \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/noise_circuit.png}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/noise_detection_circuit.png}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \caption{Schematic diagram of (a) noise generator and (b)the noise detection circuit, adapted form  \cite{signal_processor}.}
    \label{fig: noise detection}
  \end{figure}
 Fig. \ref{fig: noise detection}(a) shows the circuit of the first step.
 I put one plain channel to emphasize the noise signal with the unperturbed one.
 Fig. \ref{fig: noise detection}(b) represents the circuit of the second step.
 In this case, I plot a gain in the function of phase difference which must be measured precisely so that can give reliability to a regression.
 Therefore, I put two more channels in the oscilloscope, a reference and the noise signal each.
 The raw data of this experiment is plotted \ref{results: noise detection}.

\subsection{Lock-In detection: DC offset stability}
 To find a drift slope of a DC offset, the experiment is performed by the following circuit.
 Also, in this experiment the phase difference is fixed up to $\pi$, the circuit contains two more channels of reference and phase-shifted reference signal.
 \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/DC_off_set_circuit.png}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../raw_data/TEK00640.PNG}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \caption{Schematic diagram of (a) Lock-In DC offset stability measure circuit, adapted form  \cite{signal_processor}.
    (b)The oscilloscope screen capture of frequency 2 $Hz$ and $12 dB/oct$, the time constant of $0.03$ s the phase shifted value is $\pi$ the noise is added amount of $10^{-2}$.
    The blue line is the phase-shifted reference input and the yellow line is the noise-added signal.
    The purple line is the DBM Lock-In results.
    }
    \label{fig: DC_off_set_circuit}
  \end{figure}
 Fig. \ref{fig: DC_off_set_circuit}(a) is the circuit of the experiment.
 I used signal splitters in the Lock-In detector input and output to directly measure the phase difference between two inputs.
 Therefore, it can be very precisely controlled in this experiment, I have measured the gain from 25 different amounts of DC offset fixing phase difference in $\pi$.

 \subsection{Lock-In detection: Hall effect}
 The hall element signal is small so that the noise dominates the signal.
 Therefore, the frequency fixed Lock-In detection helps the signal distinguishable.
 The circuit is formed as the manual, but the phase difference is also directly measured as above experiments.
 \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/hall_sensor_circuit.png}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{7cm}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{../raw_data/TEK00697.PNG}
        \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \caption{Schematic diagram of (a) Hall element experiment circuit, adapted form  \cite{manual}.
    (b)The oscilloscope screen capture of frequency 20 $Hz$ and $12 dB/oct$, the time constant of $0.1$s, and the phase-shifted value is $\pi$.
    The yellow line is the phase-shifted reference input and the blue line is the Hall effect signal.
    The purple line is the Lock-In detected results.
    }
    \label{fig: hall_element_circuit}
  \end{figure}
 
 I measure the signal at 20 different distances at two different frequencies each.
 The Hall element sticks hard on the table, and the magnet distance is controlled by the wooden stick.
 Therefore, I can read the exact distance between the magnet and the Hall element in the measurement error of a few $mm$.

\subsection{Preamplifier}
 The output signal from the preamplifier is not uniformly amplified.
 The term gain($G$) means the real amplitude ratio between the input and the output signal.
 In each, (gain) $=$(output amplitude)$/$(input amplitude) in the unit of voltage.
 Fig. \ref{fig: preamplifier_gain_plot} shows the gain by frequency plot in different displayed gains for 2, 5, and 10.
 The results of displayed gain 1 and 20 are uploaded at \cite{github}, the following appendix in \ref{fig: file_appendix}.
 The experimental error of the voltage measurement is about $2mV$, which gives $1\%$ error which is disregarded to be plotted.
 The blue line represents each displayed gain, which is far different from the real gain value.
 Also, I found that the phase is shifted by the frequency increases which is not expected.
 Fig. \ref{fig: preamplifier_phase_plot} shows the regularity of the lagged phase in the output signal of the preamplifier.
 The preamplifier circuit must contain the transistor device, the phase and slew rate response are very weird to occur.
 Especially the detection amount is high enough to see the linear relationship between frequency and phase response.

    \label{fig: preamplifier_phase_plot}
  \end{figure}

  In the log scale experiment, the 3dB frequency can be found.


\subsection{Phase Shifter: Lagging phase detection}
\label{results: phase shifter}
 The phase shifter also has an unexpected phase response.
 The displayed phase shift value is controlled by two dials.
 The first dial controls the phase in a unit of $90\degree$, and the secondary fine phase dial controls the accurate proportion to the first dial.
 For example, to shift $75\degree$ the phase dial set up to $0\degree$ and the fine phase should point out $75\degree$
 It is experimentally sure that in fixed frequency, the total rotation of a phase dial spans $360\degree$ phase shift.
 However, the lagged phase is too definite to ignore, having a linear relationship with frequency.
 Fig. \ref{fig: phaseshifter_phase_plot} shows the frequency dependant lagged phase results.
 The red lines are linear regression results and fit very well.
 Specific regression results are given in Fig. \ref{fig: phase shifter linear regression results}.
 The phase shifter is usually formed based on an RC circuit.
 Contrary expectation to the ideal operational amplifier in the core of the circuit, the operational amplifier may follow Shockley's equation to ruin the frequency-independent phase shift property.
 Also, the gain has changed in the response of the circuit.
 Fig. \ref{fig: phaseshifter_gain_plot} shows the frequency dependant gain results.
 In the ideal circuit, the gain should never change from 1.
 But the experimental results do not doubt claim the phase shifter gives an unexpected gain response.
 And it is even worse, the gain data is far above 1, and peak natured.
 The data shows there are somehow resonance phenomena near 400[$Hz$].
 There are two big meanings in these results.
 First, I can never trust the displayed phase in this group of experiments.
 Since the lagged phase extends over $180\degree$, the displayed phase shift can not be trusted.
 Moreover, the preamplifier gives meaningful phase shifts and fluctuating gain results.
 This reasoning leads me to fix the circuit to directly measure the real shifted phase in the experiment.
 I don't use the linear regression results to convert the displayed phase into the real shifted phase but to put two of the signal directly in the oscilloscope.
 Secondly, the peaked nature of the gain-frequency plot means this phase shifter circuit contains RC and an operational amplifier module inside.

\end{figure}


\subsection{DBM}
As mentioned at \ref{results: phase shifter}, the yellow and purple results in Fig. \ref{fig: DBM_plot} are very effective.
The phase difference between the two inputs is directly measured and intuitively matches the DBM results.
The DBM filter works very fine but, the edgy cut at the end of the wavelength has been detected.
It is because of the fluctuation of the frequencies between two inputs caused by the phase shifter, especially in low frequencies (10~100 Hz).
But the area of those DBM results are about a few $\mu V \cdot s$, which means those edge effect can be neglectable in the calculation of Lock-In detection.
